# How Many Words v1

**How Many Words** can you make out of 9 random letters? Set your high score, then step your game up and try to top it. You've got 120 seconds.

## Getting Started

All you need is a web browser, a keyboard and your smarty pants. Be on the lookout for mobile compatibility in v2.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (vanilla)

## Rules

- Each round is 120 seconds (2 minutes).

- Each successful word is worth 1 point.

- You may use each letter in the scramble only once per word.

- Word guesses must be at least 3 letters, and no more than 9 (duh).

- You can't use the same word twice during the same round - keep an eye on your 'Words Used' list if you're unsure.

- **After 8 successful three-letter words,** your word guesses must consist of at least 4 letters.

## How to Play

- Click 'Begin' to get your scramble of 9 randomly selected letters.

- Using only the letters in the scramble (no repeats), type a word into the text field. When you've finished typing your word, hit 'Enter' or click 'Guess' to submit.

- You'll see a response message pop up just above the text box. If it's green, congrats! Your word has been accepted, and you'll see it appear in the 'Words Used' list. 

- If the response message is red, read it to see why your word was not accepted. Keep trying!

- Having trouble? Click the 'Re-Arrange!' button to change the order of letters in the scramble. This will help you to come up with more words.

- When the time expires, click 'Next Round' to get a new scramble. Try to beat your high score!

- Here's a tip for easy extra points - If you're lucky enough to get an 's' in your scramble, plurals do count as separate words, e.g. 'law' and 'laws'.
